I've migrated my old blog to Quarto. The old blogdown/hugo setup had broken the various themes and versions of tools I was using were very out of date. Rather than try to fix it, I've decided to just move things over to the more modern Quarto. This will be a bit of a work in progress as I figure things out but I've got the important stuff across.

For those new here - I don't do a lot of writing anymore. Mostly, I write about major [fitzRoy](https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy) updates, which you can see in the blog post feed.

I also keep my [AFLM Tips](../../pages/aflm-games.qmd) and [Season Predictions](../../pages/aflm-predictions.qmd) up to date, and am hoping to finally do the same thing for AFLW.

Enjoy!
